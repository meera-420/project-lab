# project-lab

Aqua lab is a portfoli website, the webiste takes you on a aquatic journey and telling a small playful story. The story is centered around a saying i always heard. " there are plenty of fish in the sea". This saying sounded so appropriate when in comes to the theme of a portfolio. Portfolios to me are have always being associated with creating a profile that sells your story. The story starts with text by introducing the quote. Then it moves on to an animations that matches up with the introduction which implies we should dive into the ocean and look closer at the fish. Finally, the user gets to meet the fish and each fish is what represents the websites i worked on before.


As for the code:

I have 5 html files, 1 css, and 1 javascript . I found that it was the most convenient for me to the css for each html within the html file. However the css for the home page i kept in the css file. The javascript has the code for the animation of the home page and the animation for the fish.

Initially i wanted to make the animating fish have a href link to the website i needed to link . However, the animation was not working when the link was added to it, that was where i faced my main issue. That is why i went with a different plan. I left the animation as a means of entertainment for the user, then created profiles for the fish that then link to the websites.
